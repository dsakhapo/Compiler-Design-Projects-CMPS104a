This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Darius Sakhapour (dsakhapo@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Richa Goyal (riagoyal@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together, learning from each other, to to divide the work into two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Darius Sakhapour spent		_7_ hours working alone.
Richa Goyal spent		_7__ hours working alone.
We spent 			_15_ hour working together.
Darius Sakhapour spent		_7_ hours driving.
Richa Goyal spent		_7__ hours driving.
