NOTES:

-For the .str output file, I dumped only the tokens from the hashtable,
I did not include any of the hash information that he outputted by default.
I hope this was ok as I didn't see any need for the extra hash info nor did I see
any explicit instructions to include it.

-I noticed in the SCORE.asg1 file, that there were the following criteria under 
PROGRAM TESTING,

(3) unordered_set properly printed out as per asg1 spec.

(3) nothing printed to stdout.

so I have all the hashing info that's not included in the .str file, display when the program is run,
but nothing else. I hope this is ok as I wasn't sure whether to get rid of all output completely as 
these categories seem contradictory. Thanks for your time.
